				<h1>Why Bumble?</h1>
				<p>
					Bumble was first founded to
					challenge the antiquated rules
					of dating. Now, Bumble
					empowers users to connect with
					confidence whether dating,
					networking, or meeting friends
					online. Weâ€™ve made it not only
					necessary but acceptable for
					women to make the first move,
					shaking up outdated gender
					norms. We prioritise kindness
					and respect, providing a safe
					online community for users to
					build new relationships.
